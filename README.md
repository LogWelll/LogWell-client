# LogWell-client

## Introduction
LogWell-client is a hassle-free Python client to send logs to an instance of [LogWell-service](https://github.com/LogWelll/LogWell-service).  
LogWell-client is for you, if you are determined to use LogWell-service to stash your logs and want to avoid plain HTTP calls every now and then throughout your code base.

## Features
1. **Sync and Async clients** for log creation
2. **Blocking and Non-blocking** log creation support
3. Compatible with Pythonâ€™s built-in `logging` module through a custom handler

## Installation
Install the LogWell-client using the following command:

```bash
pip install logwell-client
```

## Log Schema

A log object in the client follows the same type (`pydantic.BaseModel`) and structure as the service, except for the `uid` and `created_at` fields that are generated automatically at the server upon receiving a log instance; therefore, from LogWell-client perspective, a log consists of the following fields:

```python
tenant: str | None = None                                       # an identifier to the creator (service) of the log
log: dict | str = Field(default_factory=dict)                   # the actual log to save
execution_path: dict | None = None                              # the execution path, leading to where the log is introduced
metadata: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)                    # additional metadata to stroe
tag: str | None = None                                          # a custom tag to query a log or a family of logs
level: Level = Level.NOTSET                                     # the level to produce the log; available options are: ["INFO", "TRACE","DEBUG", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL", "FATAL", "NOTSET",]
group_path: List[str] | None = None                             # a group path, to register nnested logs
```

## Log creation approaches
LogWell-service supports log creation through the following approaches:
   - **Naive (blocking) log creation**: LogWell-service keeps the HTTP connection open, while writing the log to the database.
   - **Non-blocking log creation using FastAPI builting BackgroundTasks**: This way, LogWell-service closes the HTTP connection ASAP and afterwards, the log creation is done as an instance of `FastAPI.BackgroundTasks`.
   - **Advanced non-blocking**: In this case, LogWell-service uses a message queue and a celery worker to queue the log as a message and a spearate celery worker takes care of writing it to the database.

In LogWell-client, the log creation approach is specified using the following `StrEnum`:

```python
class Endpoint(StrEnum):
    Blocking = "/logs/"
    NonBlocking = "/logs/non-blocking/"
    BuiltInNonBlocking = "/logs/non-blocking/builtin/"
```


## Usage
LogWell-client can be used to both create logs and read logs, as follow:

### Log creation
LogWell-client can be either used at client-level or as a custom handler -- to be added to an instance of `logging.Logger` -- to create logs; each of these approaches are discussed separately:

#### 1. Using client(s either sync or async)

  - ##### Synchronous client:
    ```python
    from logwell_client.client import SyncLogClient
    from logwell_client.schema import LogCreateSchema

    client = SyncLogClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000/", api_key="key1", tenant="tenant1")

    response = client.create_log(
        log=LogCreateSchema(
            log="hello world",
            metadata={"client_ip": "127.0.0.1"},
            level="INFO",
            tag="tag1",
        )
    )

    print(response.json())
    client.close()

    >>> OUTPUT:
    {'message': 'Log added successfully', 'data': {'tenant': 'tenant1', 'log': 'hello world', 'execution_path': None, 'metadata': {'client_ip': '127.0.0.1'}, 'tag': 'tag1', 'level': 'INFO', 'group_path': None, 'uid': '680a28ad-88fd-456a-ac81-6d3c42334f33', 'created_at': '2025-08-20T11:21:28.914545'}}
    ```

- ##### Asynchronous client:
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from logwell_client.client import AsyncLogClient, Endpoint
    from logwell_client.schema import LogCreateSchema

    async def main():
        client = AsyncLogClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000/", api_key="key1", tenant="tenant1")
        response = await client.create_log(
            log=LogCreateSchema(
                log="hello async world",
                metadata={"client_ip": "127.0.0.1"},
                level="INFO",
                tag="tag2",
            )
        )
        print(response.json())
        await client.aclose()

    asyncio.run(main())

    >>> OUTPUT:
    {'message': 'Log added successfully', 'data': {'tenant': 'tenant1', 'log': 'hello async world', 'execution_path': None, 'metadata': {'client_ip': '127.0.0.1'}, 'tag': 'tag2', 'level': 'INFO', 'group_path': None, 'uid': '420f3c26-8474-4fe9-a7ff-10ad6683ee38', 'created_at': '2025-08-20T11:22:31.195423'}}
    ```

#### 2. Using the Logging Handler

LogWell-client also provides a `logging.Handler` implementation to seamlessly integrate with Python logging:

```python
import logging
from logwell_client.handler import LogServiceHandler

logger = logging.getLogger("my-app")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

handler = LogServiceHandler(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="key1",
    tenant="tenant1",
)
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.info(
    "Hello world!",
    extra={
        "metadata": {"client_ip": "127.0.0.1"},
        "tag": "tag1",
    },
)
```

### Log retrieval
Using LogWell-client to read logs, requires instanciating from the following `LogQuerySchema` class:

```python
class QueryParams(BaseModel):
    offset: int | None = 0
    limit: int | None = 10

class GroupPathFlag(StrEnum):
    ExactOnly = "exact_only"
    AllChildren = "all_children"


class LogQuerySchema(BaseModel):
    list: bool | None = None
    uid: str | None = None
    tag: str | None = None
    level: Level | None = None
    group_path: str | None = None
    group_path_flag: GroupPathFlag | None = None
    query_params: QueryParams | None = None
```

This can be done, either as `LogQuerySchema` or python `dict`. Almost all the attributes of `LogQuerySchema` are self-descriptory, therefore, we avoid defining everyone of them. Followings though, require defining them as below:

  -   `group_path_flag` determines either logs with the exact `group_path` or all children under the `group_path` are desired.
  -    `query_params` LogWell-service supports query parameters to retrieve logs from the service; to do so, two attributes of `offset` and `limit` can be passed to tune the range of logs supposed to be retrieved.

**Attention**: Amongst `list`, `uid`, `tag`, `level` and `group_path` you are supposed to declare one of them.

- #### Synchronous client:
Below, examples to retrieve logs through different query options are provided:

-   ##### Get the whole list:
    ```python
    from logwell_client.client import SyncLogClient

    # instanciate the sync client
    client = SyncLogClient(
        base_url="http://localhost:8000/",
        api_key="api_key",
    )

    log_list = client.read_log(
        query={
            "list": True,
        }
    )

    print(
        log_list.json()
    )
    ```

-   ##### Get by UID:
    ```python
    log = client.read_log(
        query={
            "uid": "desired_uid",
        }
    )

    print(log.json())
    ```
-   ##### Get by tag:
    ```python
    tag_logs = client.read_log(
        query={
            "tag": "desired_tag",
        }
    )

    print(
        tag_logs.json()
    )
    ```

    ##### Get by level:
    ```python
    level_logs = client.read_log(
    query={
        "level": "desired_level",
        }
    )

    print(
        level_logs.json()
    )
    ```

    ##### Get by Group path (exact):
    ```python
    group_path_logs = client.read_log(
    query={
        "group_path": "desired_group_path",
        "group_path_flag": "exact_only",
        }
    )

    print(
        group_path_logs.json()
    )
    ```

    ##### Get by Group path (all children):
    ```python
    group_path_logs = client.read_log(
    query={
        "group_path": "desired_group_path",
        "group_path_flag": "all_children",
        }
    )

    print(
        group_path_logs.json()
    )
    ```

- #### Asynchronous client:
The asynchronous client uses absolutely similar interface to communicate with, except that executing asynchronous functions are more complicated. Below is an example to try out log retrieval using the asynchronous client.

```python
from logwell_client.client import AsyncLogClient
import asyncio

AsyncLogClient = AsyncLogClient(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/",
    api_key="key1"
)


async def main():
    log = await AsyncLogClient.read_log(
        query={
            "uid": "desired_uid",
        }
    )

    print(log.json())


asyncio.run(main())
```
